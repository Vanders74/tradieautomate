      <h1>About TradieAutomate</h1>

      <p>
        TradieAutomate exists for one reason: <strong>Australian solar, battery and electrical installers deserve better tools and clearer information.</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        The compliance landscape for installers is shifting fast — CER enforcement is tightening, AS/NZS standards are updating, and the gap between "getting it right" and "getting caught out" is shrinking every year.
      </p>

      <p>
        Meanwhile, most trade businesses are still running on paper checklists, scattered photos, and manual processes that don't scale.
      </p>

      <h2>What We Cover</h2>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Solar & Battery Compliance</strong> — CER requirements, AS/NZS 5033, AS/NZS 5139, STC documentation, audit preparation</li>
        <li><strong>EV Charging Installation</strong> — Appendix P, load balancing, emerging standards</li>
        <li><strong>Digital Job Management</strong> — Software comparisons, workflow automation, going paperless</li>

      </ul>

      <h2>Who's Behind This</h2>

      <p>
        TradieAutomate is built by people who understand both the trades industry and the technology that's transforming it. We're not just writing about compliance — we're building the resources installers actually need.
