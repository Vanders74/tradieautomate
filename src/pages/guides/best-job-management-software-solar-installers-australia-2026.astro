  {
    question: "What is the best job management software for solar installers in Australia?",
    answer: "ServiceM8 is widely regarded as the best job management software for Australian solar installers in 2026. It is specifically built for compliance-heavy trades, supporting CER checklists, STC documentation, AS/NZS 5033 and 5139 sign-off forms, and digital evidence capture. For smaller operations with simpler compliance needs, Tradify and Fergus are cost-effective alternatives."
  },
  {
    question: "Does ServiceM8 work for CER compliance documentation?",
    answer: "Yes. ServiceM8 supports CER (Clean Energy Regulator) compliance documentation through customisable job templates and checklists. Installers can build CER-specific inspection forms, attach timestamped photos, and capture digital client sign-offs — all stored against the job record for audit purposes. This makes it well-suited to CER-accredited businesses subject to compliance audits."
  },
  {
    question: "How do solar installers manage STC paperwork digitally?",
    answer: "Solar installers can manage STC (Small-scale Technology Certificate) paperwork digitally using job management platforms like ServiceM8. The typical workflow involves attaching system design documents and installation evidence to the job record, capturing photos of the completed installation, obtaining digital client sign-off, and exporting job records for submission to the STC registry. ServiceM8's templating system allows STC-specific forms to be built once and reused across all jobs."
  },
  {
    question: "What software do Australian electricians use for job management?",
    answer: "The most commonly used job management platforms among Australian electricians and solar installers are ServiceM8, Tradify, AroFlo, simPRO, and Fergus. ServiceM8 has the largest adoption among small-to-medium trade businesses due to its Australian-focused compliance features and ease of use. AroFlo and simPRO are preferred by larger contractors managing complex projects."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I create AS/NZS compliance checklists in ServiceM8?",
    answer: "Yes. ServiceM8 allows users to build custom job forms that can replicate AS/NZS 5033 (solar installation) and AS/NZS 5139 (battery storage) inspection checklists. These forms can include pass/fail checkpoints, photo attachment fields, and signature capture. Completed forms are stored digitally against each job record, providing a compliant audit trail."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the difference between ServiceM8 and Tradify for solar businesses?",
    answer: "ServiceM8 and Tradify are both popular with Australian trade businesses, but differ in compliance depth. ServiceM8 offers more advanced compliance form building, CER-specific templates, and digital sign-off workflows — making it the stronger choice for solar and battery installers with strict documentation requirements. Tradify is simpler and more affordable per user, making it better suited to small businesses where compliance paperwork is less complex. If CER documentation or AS/NZS audit trails are a priority, ServiceM8 is the better fit."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I go paperless as a solar installer in Australia?",
    answer: "Going paperless as an Australian solar installer involves three key steps: (1) adopting a job management platform like ServiceM8 that supports digital forms, photo capture, and client sign-off; (2) digitising your compliance checklists (CER, AS/NZS 5033, AS/NZS 5139) as reusable templates; and (3) setting up a digital filing system for STC documentation, certificates of compliance, and audit records. Most solar businesses can go fully paperless within 4–8 weeks of implementing a suitable platform."
  },
  {
    question: "Is there job management software specifically for CER-accredited installers?",
    answer: "While no job management platform is exclusively built for CER-accredited installers, ServiceM8 is the most widely adopted solution among CER-accredited solar and battery installers in Australia. Its customisable compliance forms, digital evidence capture, and audit-ready job records align closely with CER documentation requirements. TradieAutomate provides guides on configuring ServiceM8 workflows for CER compliance."

        <p class="tldr-label">⚡ TL;DR — Quick Answer</p>
        <p>
          For Australian solar and battery installers in 2026, <strong>ServiceM8</strong> is the leading job management platform built specifically for compliance-heavy trades. It supports CER documentation, STC paperwork, AS/NZS compliance checklists, and digital sign-offs — eliminating paper-based audit risk. Tradify and AroFlo are strong alternatives for larger operations needing project management. Choose based on team size, compliance requirements, and whether you need CER-specific workflow support.
        </p>
      </div>

      <p>
        Australian solar and battery installers face unique compliance pressures that generic job management software wasn't built to handle — CER audit requirements, STC documentation, AS/NZS 5033 and 5139 checklists, and the constant risk of paper records going missing before an inspection. The right software eliminates that risk while speeding up every job from booking to invoice.
      </p>

      <p>
        This guide ranks the five most widely used job management platforms among Australian solar installers in 2026, with a detailed comparison table, selection criteria, and answers to the questions installers actually ask.

      <!-- How to Choose -->
      <h2>How to Choose the Right Platform</h2>

      <p>Not every solar business has the same needs. Use these five criteria to narrow your choice:</p>

      <ul class="checklist">
        <li>
          <strong>Compliance depth required.</strong> If you're CER-accredited and subject to audits, prioritise platforms with custom form builders and digital sign-off (ServiceM8 is the clear leader here). Simpler businesses can get by with basic job tracking.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Team size and growth trajectory.</strong> Solo operators and small teams (1–5) do well on Tradify or Fergus. Growing businesses (5–20+) benefit from ServiceM8's workflow automation. Large contractors should evaluate AroFlo or simPRO.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>CER-specific workflow needs.</strong> If your business depends on STC paperwork, AS/NZS checklists, and CER audit readiness, choose a platform that supports custom form templates — not just basic job notes.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Budget and per-user costs.</strong> Fergus and Tradify are most affordable per seat. ServiceM8's flat monthly pricing becomes better value as team size grows. AroFlo and simPRO carry higher baseline costs but offer more capability at scale.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Integration with your accounting software.</strong> Check that your chosen platform integrates with Xero, MYOB, or QuickBooks. ServiceM8, Tradify, AroFlo, and simPRO all offer accounting integrations — confirm compatibility before committing.
        </li>
      </ul>
