If you're installing solar panels in Australia, compliance isn't optional — it's the foundation of your business.

The Clean Energy Regulator (CER) has been tightening enforcement. In recent years, installer accreditation reviews have increased significantly, and the penalties for non-compliance are getting steeper.

This checklist covers everything you need to have in order **before, during, and after** every solar installation job.

## Before the Job

- ✅ Inverter listed on the CEC Approved Inverter List
- ✅ Panels listed on the CEC Approved Modules List
- ✅ String sizing calculations documented
- ✅ Roof structural assessment completed (if required)

### Customer Documentation

Compliance isn't just about avoiding penalties — it's about building a reputation that generates referrals and repeat business.

The installers who treat compliance as a feature (not a burden) are the ones winning the best contracts and commanding premium prices.
