Every solar installer eventually hits the same wall.

Jobs are coming in. Revenue is growing. But somewhere between booking the job, completing the install, and getting paid, the admin piles up — and the compliance paperwork starts slipping.

A missed form here. A photo buried in someone's camera roll there. An STC lodgement that goes out a week late because nobody was tracking it.

**This is where good businesses stall — and where ServiceM8 changes everything.**

## What Is ServiceM8?

ServiceM8 is a cloud-based job management platform built specifically for trade businesses. For solar and battery installers in Australia, it solves the exact problems that kill cash flow and create compliance risk:

- Jobs get booked, dispatched, and tracked in one place
- Compliance photos and forms attach directly to job records
- Invoices go out automatically when the job is marked complete
- Customers get live updates and arrival ETAs without anyone picking up the phone

It's not a generic CRM duct-taped into a trades context. It was designed from the ground up for how trade businesses actually operate.

## The Compliance Problem ServiceM8 Solves

Since the updated **AS/NZS 5139:2019** standard came into effect for battery energy storage systems, the Clean Energy Regulator has been ramping up audits and enforcement actions.

The installers who get caught out aren't cutting corners on the physical install — they're getting hit on **documentation**.

Missing compliance checklists. Incorrect inverter labels. No signed customer handover forms. Photos that can't be tied to a specific job and date.

ServiceM8 addresses this directly:

### Digital Job Checklists

Every job in ServiceM8 can include a custom form or checklist that must be completed before the job can be marked done. For solar and battery installs, this means:

- Pre-install compliance checks happen on-site, on the device, before the tech drives away
- Every completed checklist is timestamped and attached to the job record
- CER audit prep becomes a matter of filtering and exporting — not a frantic search through filing cabinets

### Photo Capture Tied to Jobs

When a technician takes a compliance photo through ServiceM8, it's automatically attached to that job record with a timestamp and GPS location. Not in a camera roll. Not in a WhatsApp thread. **Attached to the job, permanently, retrievable in seconds.**

For CER audits, this is the difference between a two-hour document collection exercise and a ten-minute export.

### Certificate Generation

For solar installations requiring STC documentation and compliance certificates, ServiceM8 supports PDF form generation directly from completed job data. Customer signatures can be captured on a tablet at the time of installation — no paper, no scanning, no chasing signatures after the fact.

## The Cash Flow Impact

Beyond compliance, the cash flow impact for solar businesses using ServiceM8 is significant.

The average trade business on ServiceM8 reduces its time-to-invoice by over 80% — going from invoicing days or weeks after a job to invoicing automatically when the job is marked complete.

For a solar installation business doing 15-25 jobs per month at $5,000-$15,000 per job, that compression in the invoice cycle can free up tens of thousands of dollars in cash flow that was previously locked in "work done but not yet billed."

**Automated payment reminders** handle the follow-up. Not a staff member. Not a text from the business owner. An automated sequence that goes out at the right intervals until the invoice is paid.

## Scheduling and Dispatch

Running multiple crews — or even just two technicians — without a centralised scheduling system creates collisions, gaps, and last-minute scrambles.

ServiceM8's scheduling view gives you:

- A live map showing where every staff member is right now
- Drag-and-drop job scheduling that updates technicians' queues in real time
- Automated job confirmation messages to customers (including 24-hour reminders)
- The ability to reassign jobs from the office when something changes on-site

For solar businesses that do both residential and commercial work, being able to see the full week at a glance — and move things around without a chain of phone calls — is a material productivity improvement.

## The Customer Experience Advantage

Australian homeowners increasingly choose trade businesses based on reviews and reputation, not just price.

ServiceM8 helps you collect five-star Google reviews systematically rather than accidentally. After a job is completed and invoiced, an automated follow-up goes out asking the customer to leave a review. Businesses using this system average 4.8+ stars on Google — not because their work is necessarily better than competitors, but because they ask every single customer rather than hoping the happy ones volunteer.

That review velocity compounds. More reviews means higher visibility in local search. Higher visibility means more enquiries without additional ad spend.

## Is ServiceM8 Right for Your Solar Business?

ServiceM8 is best suited for solar installation businesses that:

- Are running 2+ technicians and managing scheduling across multiple crews
- Are experiencing compliance friction (missed forms, disorganised photos, late STC submissions)
- Want to reduce admin hours without hiring a dedicated office manager
- Are ready to professionalise their customer communication (confirmations, ETAs, invoices, reviews)

If you're a sole trader doing a handful of jobs per month, a simpler setup might be enough for now. But the moment you start thinking about growth — adding crew, scaling to commercial work, or building a business you could eventually sell — the foundations ServiceM8 provides become extremely valuable.
