Battery storage is now a standard part of the solar conversation in Australia. In 2025, more than 60% of new residential solar installations included a battery — up from under 20% five years ago.

But with that growth has come increased regulatory scrutiny. The Clean Energy Regulator has made it clear: AS/NZS 5139 compliance isn't optional, and enforcement is increasing.

This article breaks down what the standard actually requires, where installers commonly get it wrong, and how to make sure every job you do passes — first time.

## What Is AS/NZS 5139?

AS/NZS 5139:2019 is the Australian and New Zealand standard for battery energy storage systems (BESS) used with renewable energy generation. It covers design, installation, maintenance, and safety requirements for battery systems connected to solar arrays.

It replaced and significantly updated the previous guidance that applied to battery installations, and it applies to:

- Lithium-ion battery systems (the dominant technology in residential and small commercial installs)
- Lead-acid and flow battery systems
- Any battery storage connected to a PV array or grid-connected inverter

The standard is referenced in CER accreditation requirements and is the benchmark used during CEC audits.

## The 4 Areas Where Installers Most Often Fail

After reviewing audit outcomes and installer feedback across the industry, four areas account for the majority of compliance failures:

### 1. Clearance and Location Requirements

AS/NZS 5139 specifies minimum separation distances between battery systems and:

- Openable windows and doors (minimum 600mm in most cases)
- Air conditioning intakes and exhaust vents
- Gas meters and electrical switchboards
- Sleeping areas (specific restrictions for indoor installations)
- Property boundaries

These requirements exist to prevent thermal runaway events from spreading to adjacent areas. The most common failure is batteries installed too close to air conditioning units or laundry doors — often because the customer preferred the location aesthetically.

**The fix:** Measure and document clearances for every install. If the customer's preferred location doesn't comply, document the alternative you recommended and get their sign-off on the final location.

### 2. Signage and Labelling

The standard requires specific warning labels on battery systems, switchboards connected to batteries, and any isolating devices. Requirements include:

- Battery system warning label at the battery unit itself
- Labels at the switchboard identifying the battery circuit
- Emergency isolation point labelling
- Appropriate hazard symbols for lithium-ion systems

Failure rate here is high — not because installers are unaware, but because labels are often forgotten in the final rush to complete a job. A missing label on an otherwise perfect install is still a compliance failure.

**The fix:** Build signage into your job completion checklist. A checklist item that cannot be ticked until photos of the installed labels are attached to the job record creates the accountability that prevents this.

### 3. Documentation and Handover

Every battery installation must be accompanied by a handover package that includes:

- A completed compliance checklist signed by the installer
- System specifications and equipment datasheets
- Operating and maintenance instructions for the homeowner
- Emergency procedures documentation
- Connection to the electrical certificate of compliance

Missing or incomplete handover documentation is the single most common reason for audit failures. The CER has made clear that documentation failures will be treated as compliance failures — regardless of whether the physical installation is correct.

**The fix:** Never mark a job complete until the documentation is done. Digital job management systems like ServiceM8 allow you to make documentation completion a required step before the job status can be updated — removing the possibility of driving away without completing the paperwork.

### 4. Thermal Management and Ventilation

AS/NZS 5139 specifies requirements for the thermal environment in which batteries are installed. This includes:

- Operating temperature ranges that must be maintained
- Ventilation requirements for enclosed installations
- Restrictions on installation in areas exposed to direct sunlight without thermal mitigation

Roof spaces, garages without ventilation, and enclosed outdoor cabinet installations are the common failure points. Batteries operating outside their specified temperature range degrade faster and present a greater safety risk — and the CER is well aware of this.

**The fix:** During the site assessment, evaluate the installation location's thermal environment across seasons — not just on install day. Document your assessment and the mitigation measures (additional ventilation, shade structures, cabinet selection) you specified.

## What CER Auditors Actually Look For

CER audit inspectors are typically experienced electrical professionals. They're not trying to catch installers out — they're verifying that the installation meets the standard.

In practice, audits focus on:

**Physical inspection:**
- Clearances from windows, doors, and vents (measured on-site)
- Labelling and signage (checked against the standard)
- Cable management and protection
- Isolator accessibility

**Documentation review:**
- Compliance checklists (signed and complete)
- Equipment certification (inverter and battery on approved lists)
- Electrical certificate of compliance
- Installer accreditation verification

**Customer interview:**
- Was handover documentation provided?
- Were emergency procedures explained?
- Does the customer know how to operate the system?

The customer interview element surprises many installers. A technically perfect installation can still result in a compliance finding if the customer has no idea how to isolate the system in an emergency.

## Building a Compliant Process

The installers who consistently pass audits aren't necessarily the most technically skilled — they're the most systematically compliant.

The difference is process:

1. **Pre-installation checklist** — site assessment completed, clearances measured, location approved, equipment verified against CEC approved lists
2. **During-installation checklist** — progress photos taken at key stages, cable management documented, labels installed as you go
3. **Completion checklist** — all labels present and photographed, compliance checklist completed and signed, handover documentation prepared, customer briefed
4. **Job closure** — all documentation attached to job record, electrical certificate submitted, STC paperwork lodged

When every install follows the same process — captured digitally, tied to the job record, retrievable in seconds — audits stop being stressful.

## The Role of Job Management Software

Paper checklists get lost. Photos in camera rolls can't be tied to a specific job or date. Handover forms left in the van create liability.

Job management platforms like ServiceM8 solve this by making documentation a built-in part of the workflow rather than an afterthought:

- Custom forms built for AS/NZS 5139 requirements
- Photo capture tied to job records with timestamp and GPS
- Digital customer signatures at handover
- Automated follow-up for outstanding documentation
- Instant export for CER audit requests

For businesses doing more than 10 battery installations per month, the documentation overhead of paper-based systems is significant. Digital job management pays for itself many times over in time saved — before you even account for the audit risk reduction.

## Summary: What You Need for Every Battery Install

Before you drive away from any battery installation job, confirm:

- [ ] Clearances measured and documented (windows, doors, vents, switchboard)
- [ ] All required labels installed and photographed
- [ ] Compliance checklist completed and signed
- [ ] Equipment verified against current CEC approved lists
- [ ] Customer briefed on operation and emergency procedures
- [ ] Handover documentation provided to customer
- [ ] Electrical certificate of compliance issued
- [ ] Photos attached to job record
- [ ] STC paperwork prepared for lodgement

If every box is ticked before you leave the site, you're audit-ready.
