Here's a scenario most solar installers will recognise:

You finish a job. Photos are on three different phones. The compliance checklist is on a clipboard in the van. The customer's signed form is... somewhere. And the STC paperwork needs to be submitted by Friday.

Now multiply that by 20 jobs a month.

**This is where most installers lose time, money, and occasionally their accreditation.**

## The Problem With Paper

Paper-based systems worked fine when you were running 5 jobs a month as a sole trader. But the moment you add a second crew, hire an apprentice, or try to scale past $500K revenue, the cracks appear fast:

- **No audit trail** — when the CER asks for installation records from 18 months ago, you're digging through filing cabinets
- **Inconsistent documentation** — every installer fills out forms differently
- **No real-time visibility** — you don't know what stage each job is at without calling someone
- **Duplicate data entry** — quoting in one system, scheduling in another, invoicing in a third

## What Digital Job Management Actually Solves

A good job management platform doesn't just replace paper — it creates a **single source of truth** for every job:

### 1. Quote → Schedule → Complete → Invoice (One System)
No more copying job details between 4 different tools. One entry flows through the entire job lifecycle.

### 2. Compliance Documentation Built In
Digital forms, photo capture, checklists — all attached to the job record. When the auditor calls, you pull up the job in 10 seconds.

### 3. Real-Time Job Tracking
Know which jobs are scheduled, in progress, or complete. From your phone.

### 4. Automated Communication
Job confirmations, on-the-way texts, completion summaries — sent automatically. Your customers feel looked after without you lifting a finger.

### 5. Financial Clarity
Know your job costs, margins, and outstanding invoices in real time. Not at the end of the quarter when your accountant tells you the bad news.

## What to Look For

Not all job management platforms are built for trades. Here's what matters for solar/electrical installers specifically:

- **Custom forms** — you need forms that match your compliance requirements, not generic templates
- **Photo capture with GPS/timestamp** — proves you were on site, when, and what you installed
- **Asset tracking** — serial numbers, panel locations, inverter details linked to each job
- **Mobile-first** — if it doesn't work brilliantly on a phone, your crew won't use it
- **Unlimited users** — some platforms charge per user, which kills you as you grow
- **Integration with accounting** — Xero/MYOB sync saves hours of double entry

## The Cost of NOT Switching

Here's the maths most installers don't do:

- **1 hour/day** on admin that could be automated = **260 hours/year**
- At a charge-out rate of $100/hr, that's **$26,000/year** in lost productive time
- **One failed audit** from poor documentation = potential **loss of CEC accreditation** = loss of ability to create STCs = your business model is gone

The cost of a job management platform? Usually $30-150/month.

## The Bottom Line

The solar industry is maturing. The installers who are building systems — digital workflows, automated compliance, real-time tracking — are the ones who'll still be here in 5 years.

The ones still running on WhatsApp groups and paper checklists? They're one CER audit away from a very bad day.

**Start evaluating. Start small. But start.**
